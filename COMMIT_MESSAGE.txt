refactor: restructure project architecture for better scalability

Major architectural improvements to prepare for future features (photo recognition, voice messages, onboarding):

**Session Management System:**
- Add centralized session management (sessions/session_manager.py)
- Implement session types: DEFAULT, EDITING, ONBOARDING, KBJU_SETUP, TIMEZONE_SETUP
- Each session handles text, photo, and voice messages independently
- Easy to add new session types in the future

**Database Refactoring:**
- Split database.py (536 lines) into domain-specific modules:
  - database/connection.py - connection management and initialization
  - database/users.py - user operations
  - database/days.py - day operations
  - database/food_entries.py - food entry operations
- Remove old database.py file
- Better code organization and maintainability

**Service Layer:**
- Add business logic layer (services/):
  - FoodService - food processing, editing, deletion
  - DayService - day management
  - UserService - user management
- Separates business logic from handlers and database
- Improves testability and code reusability

**Handlers Updates:**
- Refactor handlers to use new session system
- Add media handlers (handlers/media.py) for photo and voice support
- Update callbacks to use SessionManager for state management
- Improve code organization and separation of concerns

**Documentation:**
- Add ARCHITECTURE.md with architecture overview and best practices
- Add TESTING_CHECKLIST.md for testing guidance
- Document session system usage and extension patterns

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- All existing functionality works as before
- No breaking changes for end users

This refactoring improves code maintainability, scalability, and prepares the codebase for future features like photo recognition and voice message processing. The new architecture follows best practices and makes it easier to add new functionality.

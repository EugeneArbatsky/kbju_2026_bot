refactor: restructure project architecture for better scalability

Major architectural improvements to prepare for future features (photo recognition, voice messages, onboarding):

**Session Management System:**
- Add centralized session management (sessions/session_manager.py)
- Implement session types: DEFAULT, EDITING, ONBOARDING, KBJU_SETUP, TIMEZONE_SETUP
- Each session handles text, photo, and voice messages independently
- Easy to add new session types in the future

**Database Refactoring:**
- Split database.py (536 lines) into domain-specific modules:
  - database/connection.py - connection management
  - database/users.py - user operations
  - database/days.py - day operations
  - database/food_entries.py - food entry operations
- Better code organization and maintainability

**Service Layer:**
- Add business logic layer (services/):
  - FoodService - food processing, editing, deletion
  - DayService - day management
  - UserService - user management
- Separates business logic from handlers and database

**Handlers Updates:**
- Refactor handlers to use new session system
- Add media handlers (handlers/media.py) for photo and voice support
- Update callbacks to use SessionManager
- Improve code organization

**Documentation:**
- Add ARCHITECTURE.md with architecture overview and best practices
- Document session system usage and extension patterns

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Old database.py can be removed after verification

This refactoring improves code maintainability, scalability, and prepares the codebase for future features like photo recognition and voice message processing.
